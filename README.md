# Module20_Individual_Self_Assessment

## Self Assessment
My primary role in the final project was optimizing our regression model.  In total, it's hard to say how many trials I ran against our final project dataset in order to identify the best performing algorithm, but it's a number that is definitely above 1,000.  I delved into many algorithms that weren't covered in our course material, and I wrote some python loops in order to tune each one as best I could.  In the end, XGBoost, or e<b>X</b>treme <b>G</b>radient <b>B</b>oosting, proved to be the best solution for our project. XGBoost returned an accuracy score of 94.56%, while Historgram-based Gradient Boosting was close behind at 94.32%.  Random Forest Regression gave us an accuracy of 94.13%.

## Team Assessment
The COVID-Risk-Analysis team was fantastic.  We had a great balance between all of us, and we seemed to have a common trait amongst us .... the continued drive to attain and display the best results possible.  Naftali is a pro at Tableau, and Hiyab, Michael, and Rob did amazing jobs with the readme, the Google slids, and GitHub.  We all learned from each other aloing the way, and the efforts put in made for a fantastic final project!



## Project Summary
The features included in the model are displayed very well in our tableau presentation, with GDP per Capita, Diabetes prevalance, median age, % of population above 65, and % of population above 70 showing clear trends.

As mentioned above, XGBoost regression returned an accuracy score of 94.56%.  The final project materials can be found via the below link.
