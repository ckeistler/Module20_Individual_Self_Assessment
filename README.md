# Module20_Individual_Self_Assessment

## Self Assessment
My primary role in the final project was optimizing our regression model.  In total, it's hard to say how many trials I ran against our final project dataset in order to identify the best performing algorithm, but it's a number that is definitely above 1,000.  I delved into many algorithms that weren't covered in our course material, and I wrote some python loops in order to tune each one as best I could.  In the end, XGBoost, or e<b>X</b>treme <b>G</b>radient <b>B</b>oosting, proved to be the best solution for our project.
